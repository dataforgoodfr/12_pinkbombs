To meet 100% of the daily recommended intake with 100g, 2 to 3 tablespoons per day are sufficient. ALA type omega-3s üå±."
Biodiversity,Impact on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems & wild and farmed animal species.,5 - High environmental pressures related to salmon feeding: sourcing of vegetable meals contributes to deforestation in the Amazon; fishmeal exacerbates overfishing and the decline of wild fish populations.,"6 - Significant degradation of marine water quality: nutrient and fecal matter discharge, eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms, pesticide and microplastic discharge.","6 - The techniques used by tuna fisheries have negative effects on many non-target species (100,000 tonnes of bycatch and discards each year in global tuna fisheries).","4 - Terrestrial and freshwater acidification, depletion of energy and water resources, ecotoxicity to freshwater aquatic ecosystems.",4 - Depletion of energy resources.,"5 - Terrestrial and freshwater acidification, depletion of mineral resources.",2 - Low impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and on wildlife.,1 - Organic production of rapeseed oil has almost no impact.
Carbon footprint,Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.,6 - The carbon footprint of salmon (land-based farmed) is estimated to be between 2 and 14 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of salmon produced.,5 - The carbon footprint of salmon (marine-based farmed) is estimated to be between 7 and 10 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of salmon produced.,3 - The carbon footprint of albacore tuna is estimated to be 4.4 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of tuna produced.,4 - The carbon footprint of sardines/mackerel is estimated to be 7.26 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced.,4 - The carbon footprint of shellfish is estimated to be 5.7 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced.,"4 - The carbon footprint of seaweed is estimated to be 6.7 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (average of ulva, nori, Breton kombu, sea bean).",1 - The carbon footprint of smoked salmon substitute is estimated to be 1.6 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced.,2 - The carbon footprint of rapeseed oil is estimated to be 2.3 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced.
Social impacts,"Impacts on human rights, food access equity, and employment.",6 - Significant diversion of soybean production and small pelagic fishing to feed salmon at the expense of human populations; 90% of the catches from global reduction fisheries are composed of species directly edible by humans.,6 - Significant diversion of soybean production and small pelagic fishing to feed salmon at the expense of human populations; 90% of the catches from global reduction fisheries are composed of species directly edible by humans.,"6 - Farming tuna (55% of produced tuna) pollutes water and land with chemicals and antibiotics. The fish can get sick, and diseases can spread quickly through seabirds that feed on them.","4 - Fishing of sardines/mackerel takes place in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (Mediterranean, Morocco, and Mauritania) using purse seine and pelagic trawl, jeopardizing the food security of local communities.","3 - The production of shellfish is an important employment sector (about 17,000 people), primarily involving family labor.","1 - The development and consumption of seaweed are recommended for transforming the global food system by the EU, and for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) related to sustainable/low-trophic aquaculture. It is a rapidly growing sector.",2 - The production of smoked salmon substitute is local and a source of employment.,1 - The production of rapeseed oil is a promising sector for employment. It requires support for organic production.
Animal welfare,"Impact on the living conditions of animals, based on cage density, diseases, and farming and fishing practices.","6 - In land-based salmon farms, densities range from 70 kg to 150 kg of salmon per cubic meter of water, which increases the risk of infectious diseases.","5 - In marine salmon farms (open net pen), densities are around 25 kg of salmon per cubic meter of water. Welfare is degraded beyond a threshold of approximately 10-20 kg/m3.","6 - Suffering of captured tunas; after suffocation and agony, they are frozen alive in the holds of ships. 100,000 tonnes of non-targeted species are captured and discarded each year in global tuna fisheries.",3 - Stress and suffering associated with the agony of fish trapped in nets.,2 - Little impact on animal welfare.,1 - No impact on animal welfare.,1 - No impact on animal welfare.,1 - No impact on animal welfare.
