Biodiversity,Impact on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems & wild and farmed animal species.,5 - High environmental pressures related to salmon feeding: sourcing of vegetable meals contributes to deforestation in the Amazon; fishmeal exacerbates overfishing and the decline of wild fish populations.,"6 - Significant degradation of marine water quality: nutrient and fecal matter discharge, eutrophication and phytoplankton blooms, pesticide and microplastic discharge.","6 - The techniques used by tuna fisheries have negative effects on many non-target species (100,000 tonnes of bycatch and discards each year in global tuna fisheries).","4 - Terrestrial and freshwater acidification, depletion of energy and water resources, ecotoxicity to freshwater aquatic ecosystems.",4 - Depletion of energy resources.,"5 - Terrestrial and freshwater acidification, depletion of mineral resources.",2 - Low impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and on wildlife.,1 - Very limited impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and on wildlife.
Carbon footprint,Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.,6 - The carbon footprint of salmon (land-based ) is estimated to be between 2 and 14 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of salmon produced.,5 - The carbon footprint of salmon (marine-based farming) is estimated to be 10 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of salmon produced (according to WWF).,3 - The carbon footprint of albacore tuna is estimated to be 4.4 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg of tuna produced (according to Agribalyse).,4 - The carbon footprint of forage fish is estimated to be 7.3 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (according to Agribalyse).,3 - The carbon footprint of shellfish is estimated to be 5.7 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (according to Agribalyse).,"4 - The carbon footprint of seaweed is estimated to be 6.7 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (according to Agribalyse; average of ulva, nori, Breton kombu, sea bean).",1 - The carbon footprint of smoked salmon substitute (Similli) is estimated to be 1.6 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (according to Agribalyse).,2 - The carbon footprint of rapeseed oil is estimated to be 2.3 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg produced (according to Agribalyse).
Social impacts,"Impact on human rights, food systems, and employment.",6 - Significant diversion of soybean production and small pelagic fishing to feed salmon at the expense of human populations; 90% of the catches from global reduction fisheries are composed of species directly edible by humans.,6 - Significant diversion of soybean production and small pelagic fishing to feed salmon at the expense of human populations; 90% of the catches from global reduction fisheries are composed of species directly edible by humans.,"6 - If farmed (55%), tuna production pollutes waters and lands with chemicals and antibiotics. The fish get sick, and diseases can spread quickly through seagulls that eat them.","4 - Fishing of forage fish takes place in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean (Mediterranean, Morocco, and Mauritania) using purse seine and pelagic trawl, jeopardizing the food security of local communities.","3 - The production of shellfish is an important employment sector (about 17,000 people), primarily involving family labor.","1 - The development and consumption of seaweed are recommended for transforming the global food system by the EU, and for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) related to sustainable/low-trophic aquaculture.
